NAME
    Config::INI::Reader::Multiline - Parser for .ini files with continuation lines

SYNOPSIS
    If act.ini contains:

        [general]
        conferences = ye2003 fpw2004 \
                      apw2005 fpw2005 hpw2005 ipw2005 npw2005 ye2005 \
                      apw2006 fpw2006 ipw2006 npw2006
        cookie_name = act
        searchlimit = 20

    And your program does:

        my $config = Config::INI::Reader::Multiline->read_file('act.ini');

    Then $config contains:

        {
            general => {
                cookie_name => 'act',
                conferences => 'ye2003 fpw2004 apw2005 fpw2005 hpw2005 ipw2005 npw2005 ye2005 apw2006 fpw2006 ipw2006 npw2006',
                searchlimit => '20'
            }
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Config::INI::Reader::Multiline is a subclass of Config::INI::Reader that
    offers support for line continuations, i.e. adding a "\<newline>"
    (backslash-newline) at the end of a line to indicate the newline should be
    removed from the input stream and ignored.

    In this implementation, the backslash can be followed and preceded by
    whitespace, which will be ignored too (just as whitespace is trimmed by
    Config::INI::Reader.
